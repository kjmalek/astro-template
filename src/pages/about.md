# About

This template was built with [Astro](https://astro.build) and is a near exact copy of the default [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) theme, [Minima](https://jekyll.github.io/minima/). This was created to get a quick idea of the differences between the two static site generators.

You can find the source code for the Jekyll Minima theme at Github: [jekyll/minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima)
